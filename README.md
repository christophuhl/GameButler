       score DECIMAL(4,2) DEFAULT 0,
       time_updated TIMESTAMP,
       rank INTEGER
   );

   CREATE TABLE Scores (

Ensure Discord can connect to your local server
- Start the ngrok tunnel to your local port 3000 with `ngrok http 3000`
- Paste the forwarding link into your Discord Bot's Interaction Endpoint URL (append '/interactions' to it)
  - Forwarding link should look like: "https://9dbd-67-183-159-100.ngrok-free.app"
